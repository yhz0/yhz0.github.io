## Hello, World

(or Hello, world, whichever you prefer)

Just got to install Jekyll and start blogging on my github pages! I will be posting my opinions on various book chapters, papers, boba among other shxtes. No guarantee of correctness, of any kind, seriously. Also I am not responsible if you see my boba pics, drink a lot of boba and not go to the gym (think how much weight you gain).

## LaTeX Display

Here are some $\LaTeX$ tests.

Some inline math: Binomial formula is $$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$.

Some displayed math:
\\[
(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab +b^2
\\]

Quotes:
\\[
    x'''
\\]

Some linear program:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min \ & c^\top x \\
s.t. \ & Ax=b \\
\ & x\geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Many thanks to Cullaloe for his excellent tutorial on setting up Katex with Jekyll. [Here's a link](https://cullaloe.com/render-latex-in-jekyll/).
